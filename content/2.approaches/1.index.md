## The need for a paradigm change

> It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;
> to search out a matter is the glory of kings.
>
> Proverbs 25:2

Before we embark on the noble pursuit of reading the bible, we need to recognise that the way we have been taught to think makes engagement challenging.

For example. We are all conditioned daily to react to quick, short hits of content. The short attention span encouraged by our culture is in complete conflict with the years and decades of continual engagement demanded by the Bible.

The Bible does not conform to any perception of personal 21st century needs. There are no shortcuts, no "12 steps" or magic formulae. There's just a very long book written in a different language a long time ago in a faraway land!

Awareness of these challenges helps us sidestep issues like "lack of will-power" and develop strategies that actually address root issues in our ways of thinking - mindsets that left unchallenged would invisibly sabotage successful engagement.

> The purposes of a person’s heart are deep waters, but one who has insight draws them out.
>
> Proverbs 20:5

## Apostolic patterns and approaches

There are many ways in which the Bible can be approached. Our guiding principle is to seek out the approaches and patterns modelled by Bible's authors, the Apostles of the New Testament and the apostolic leadership of our family of churches.

In this respect, the starting point for every disciple is to take responsibility and ownership for how their relationship with the Bible develops.

> Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.
>
> James 1:22

## Discover together

Having established what we're aiming for and the ways in which we engage, here are some of the actual activities that we can engage with.

> They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles.
>
> Acts 2:42-43
